## Hello Everyone
Today we will be doing C.O.P.

# Enumeration
First, I start to poking around website. We can see a simple store website and we can click items on each
Clicking one of them directs me a URL like http://localhost:1337/view/1 and makes me curiuos. Attempting to change
1 into 0 or 5 makes the server crash. Perfect! We can assume there might be SQL injection vulnurability.

Next we can also see the source code to further understand how the website works

We can see the server uses pickle module. A quick google search for “python pickle exploit” returns a plethora of results. 
There is an excellent write up about it that goes into great detail about how the python’s pickle module works, and how it 
can be exploited, and provides an example. We can take this information to craft our own exploit!
